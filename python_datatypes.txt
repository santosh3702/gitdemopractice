Operators:

Arithmetic operator
          + , - , * ,/
assignment operator
          x=2
          x
          2
          x+=2 
          4
          x*=2
          8
          x-=2
          6
          x/=2
          3
          a,b = 5,6 (we can assign the values in oneline for two variable)
Relational operator
         Note : for equal check we need to use double == , because if single = then it represents assigning variables
         > , < , <= , >= , ==, !=
         returns true or false 
logical operator
         combing of two or more conditions we will use logical operators 
         (And) , (or) , not 
unary operatory
         n = 7
         n
         7
         n = -n
         n
         -7
 Bitwise operator
       ~(tilde),&,|,^,<<,>>
~(tilde)
  >>> ~43
-44
>>> ~0
-1
>>> ~1
-2
>>> ~-1
0


Decorators

we can change the behaviour of the the function at the time of compile time it self

so in below div is a fixed method we can not change the functionality but we we want to change the functionality then by  

def div(a,b):
    print(a/b)
    
def smart_div(func):
    def inner(a,b):
       if a<b:
          a,b = b,a
      return func(a,b)
return inner

div = smart_div(div)

div(2,4)
