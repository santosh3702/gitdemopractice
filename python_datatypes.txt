Operators:

Arithmetic operator
          + , - , * ,/
assignment operator
          x=2
          x
          2
          x+=2 
          4
          x*=2
          8
          x-=2
          6
          x/=2
          3
          a,b = 5,6 (we can assign the values in oneline for two variable)
Relational operator
         Note : for equal check we need to use double == , because if single = then it represents assigning variables
         > , < , <= , >= , ==, !=
         returns true or false 
logical operator
         combing of two or more conditions we will use logical operators 
         &(And) , |(or) , not 
unary operatory
         n = 7
         n
         7
         n = -n
         n
         -7
